# 🙂 Facial-Recognition

This is a Python project aimed at implementing facial recognition using a pretrained FaceNet model and MTCNN for face detection. Currently, it utilizes a KNN model for prediction. 

👉 My goal was to study artificial intelligence, its principles and real-world uses in computer vision.

## How to Run

👉 Only install the dependencies if you will run pre-trained.py locally! Since you may run it as a Jupyter Notebook as well.

Before running pre-trained.py, make sure you have all the dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the dependencies, run*:

```bash
../data$ python3 pre-trained.py
```

Now you can run the Jupyter Notebook.

# ðŸ™‚ Facial-Recognition

This is a Python project aimed at implementing facial recognition using a pre-trained FaceNet model and MTCNN for face detection. Currently, it utilizes a KNN model for prediction. 

ðŸ‘‰ My goal was to study artificial intelligence, its principles, and real-world uses in computer vision.

[TO-DO]

## ðŸ•¹ How to Run

ðŸ‘‰ Only install the dependencies if you will run pre-trained.py locally. You may run it as a Jupyter Notebook.

Before running pre-trained.py, make sure you have all the dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the dependencies, run:

```bash
../data$ python3 pre-trained.py
```

Now, you can run the Jupyter Notebook.
